## HangMan Game

#### The Game for two players!

**Objective**:
In this two-player game, players take turns guessing letters to reveal a hidden word. The goal is to guess the word before reaching the allowed mistake limit.

**Game Rules**:

1. **Turn-based guessing**:
Players alternate turns to guess one letter at a time.

2. **Mistake limit**:
The number of mistakes allowed depends on the difficulty level chosen. Once a player exceeds the limit, they lose the game.

3. **Winning condition**:
If a player successfully guesses the entire word within the allowed mistakes, they win.

4. **Time limit**:
Each player has 30 seconds to make their guess. Failure to guess within the time limit counts as a mistake, and the turn automatically passes to the next player.
